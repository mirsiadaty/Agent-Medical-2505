# Agent-Medical-2505

This is a built-from-scratch, fully customized language-model LM agent, with specialty in answering medical questions.

For example, see the following comprehensive medical case, where we are asking the potential disease that causes these problems for the patient.

```
A 55-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with the chief complaint of headache for three days, associated with nausea, vomiting, and visual changes. The headache was described as being sudden in onset, constant, bilateral, retro-orbital, and throbbing. The pain was a six out of ten in intensity. The pain was not alleviated with over the counter acetaminophen use. She was not able to describe any alleviating or exacerbating factors. The visual changes were described by the patient as “blurry vision” and “double vision” affecting her left eye greater than her right. She reported photophobia and difficulty keeping the left eye open. The patient described this difficulty of keeping the eye open as a weakness and not secondary to pain. She had approximately five episodes of non-bloody and non-bilious vomiting over the past three days and reported inability to tolerate her home medications. She also reported a sore throat and cough productive of yellow sputum for the previous two to three days, but denied fever, chills, chest pain, hemoptysis, or dyspnea.
Her past medical history included essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a remote history of uterine fibroids associated with iron deficiency anemia. Prescribed medications included losartan 25 milligrams (mg) and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. She had no known drug allergies, did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was unemployed and lived alone. The patient was post-menopausal and was pregnant three times-two of which were normal spontaneous deliveries with two living children and one prior abortion.
Vital signs were: temperature 98.8° Fahrenheit, heart rate 84 beats per minute, blood pressure 135/74 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and room air oxygen saturation 97%. Her body mass index was 42 (normal 18.5–24.9). Complete physical examination was unremarkable except her left eye’s lateral gaze was restricted by approximately 25%. Her visual acuity was 20/25 and 20/30, right and left eyes, respectively. Initial laboratory testing were resulted (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram was performed (Image 1).

<ResponseToUser>
The patient's presentation suggests a combination of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and electrolyte abnormalities. Key considerations include:

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**: 
   - Strongly indicated by obesity (BMI 42), headache, nausea/vomiting, sixth nerve palsy (left eye lateral gaze restriction), and visual blurring. 
   - Hyponatremia (Na 128 mmol/L) may be secondary to SIADH or thiazide-induced volume depletion, but IIH itself can cause mild hyponatremia via cerebral edema.

2. **Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH)**:
   - Triggered by respiratory infection (yellow sputum, elevated WBC) or hydrochlorothiazide use. 
   - Hypokalemia (K 3.4 mmol/L) and low chloride (Cl 88 mmol/L) support this, though thiazide-induced hypokalemia must also be considered.

3. **Infectious Causes**:
   - **Gradenigo Syndrome** (mastoiditis with sixth nerve palsy and facial pain) or sinusitis-related meningitis, given sore throat/yellow sputum and elevated WBC.
   - **Sphenoid sinus aspergillosis** could cause focal cranial nerve palsies and hyponatremia.

4. **Structural Lesions**:
   - Pituitary macroadenoma, aneurysm, or tumor compressing the abducens nerve must be excluded via **immediate neuroimaging (MRI/CT with contrast)** and **lumbar puncture** (to measure opening pressure and rule out infection/hemorrhage).

5. **Thiazide-Induced Electrolyte Imbalance**:
   - Hydrochlorothiazide contributes to hyponatremia and hypokalemia via volume depletion or SIADH.

**Recommended Actions**:
- **Urgent neuroimaging** (MRI brain with contrast/MRA) to exclude structural pathology.
- **Lumbar puncture** to assess opening pressure (elevated in IIH) and CSF analysis (cell count, protein, glucose).
- **Electrolyte correction**: Gradual sodium correction (<10-12 mmol/L/24h) to prevent osmotic demyelination. Potassium repletion if symptomatic.
- **Address infection**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate) pending culture results if sinusitis is suspected.
- **Discontinue hydrochlorothiazide** temporarily until hyponatremia resolved.

**Differential Exclusion**:
- Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (less likely without severe neurologic injury).
- Vasculopathic sixth nerve palsy (less likely given acute presentation and ICP signs).
- Malignancy (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma) requires imaging/radiology correlation.

This patient requires immediate evaluation in the emergency setting to prevent vision loss or neurologic deterioration.

The response includes lists that point to the medical references per list items generated by the agent, For example see:

```
1. The patient's left sixth nerve palsy and visual changes (blurry/double vision) suggest increased intracranial pressure (ICP), commonly seen in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in obese individuals (BMI 42). This condition is characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual deficits. <REFERENCE>DID=241203110002157,SID=joh</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE>DID=240927412005366,SID=sch</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE>DID=241104020117753,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
2. The hyponatremia (sodium 128 mmol/L) could result from syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which may be triggered by her respiratory infection (yellow sputum, elevated WBC) or hydrochlorothiazide use. SIADH is associated with hyponatremia and can exacerbate ICP-related symptoms. <REFERENCE>DID=240927413009447,SID=wal</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104026237593,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104008573958,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
3. The elevated white blood cell count (14.9 × 10³/μL) and respiratory symptoms (sore throat, yellow sputum) suggest an infectious etiology, such as sinusitis or pneumonia, which could contribute to SIADH or localized infections (e.g., sphenoid sinus aspergillosis) causing sixth nerve palsy. <REFERENCE=DID=241104008949301,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=240927413009447,SID=wal</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104001307468,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
4. Hydrochlorothiazide use is a potential cause of hyponatremia and hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) due to SIADH or volume depletion. This diuretic can also exacerbate electrolyte imbalances in the setting of vomiting-induced volume loss. <REFERENCE=DID=241203180000594,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=240927413009447,SID=wal</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=240927119001137,SID=toy</REFERENCE>  
5. Structural causes of sixth nerve palsy, such as pituitary macroadenoma with apoplexy, cerebral aneurysms, or cholesterol granuloma, must be considered. These lesions can compress the abducens nerve and elevate ICP. <REFERENCE=DID=241104035985120,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104028261154,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104031790372,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
6. Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (CSWS) is another possible cause of hyponatremia, linked to intracranial pathology (e.g., increased ICP from IIH or infection) and characterized by renal salt loss. This condition may explain the hypokalemia and low chloride (88 mmol/L). <REFERENCE=DID=241104010364700,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104011219225,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=240927412005366,SID=sch</REFERENCE>  
7. The patient’s history of hypertension and use of thiazides places her at risk for vasculopathic sixth nerve palsy, which can occur due to small vessel disease or microvascular ischemia. <REFERENCE=DID=241203131000157,SID=nel</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104025449936,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
8. Neuroimaging (MRI/CT) and lumbar puncture are critical to evaluate for structural lesions (e.g., tumors, aneurysms) and measure opening pressure to confirm IIH or other ICP-related conditions. <REFERENCE=DID=240927412005366,SID=sch</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104025449936,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
9. The absence of fever or focal deficits makes primary infections like meningitis less likely, though localized infections (e.g., sphenoid sinus aspergillosis) remain a consideration. <REFERENCE=DID=240927421001011,SID=cas</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104001307468,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>  
10. Neoplastic processes, such as skull base tumors or metastatic disease, could cause sixth nerve palsy and hyponatremia through paraneoplastic mechanisms or mass effect. <REFERENCE=DID=241104008216020,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>, <REFERENCE=DID=241104017038044,SID=pmd</REFERENCE>
